# SEVENHTEN
A simple iOS app to track my expenses. All the expenses are stored in Core Data. It uses Face/Touch ID to authenticate the user. The current project is still under development. The current stage is mainly to test the integrity of the interface and the connectivity between each interface. If you encounter problems during the test, please contact me.
